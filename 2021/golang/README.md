# Advent-Of-Code

This is my way of approaching the Advent Of Code 2021 in Golang!

To run this program yourself, create a `.env` file and add your session cookie key with the key `session`
Example:
```
SESSION=<YOUR SESSION KEY>
```

You will find your session key by:
<br/>
1)Going to https://adventofcode.com/
<br/>
2)On Chrome, InspectElement(Ctrl + Shift + I)
<br/>
3)Click on Network Tab
<br/>
4)Ctrl + R to open network activity
<br/>
5)Click on "2021"
<br/>
6)Scroll Down and Copy the Value of "cookie"
